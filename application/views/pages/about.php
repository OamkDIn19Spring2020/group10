<p>OUBusSH aka Oulu University Bus Stop Helper is designed to be an easy-to-use lightweight alternative to browsing Google Maps or Oulunjoukkoliikenne website in order to find out which bus takes you to where you want to go. All you need to do is click the big button on the main page and select one of the destinations. It will then give you a list of all the busses headed that way from the Oulu University.
